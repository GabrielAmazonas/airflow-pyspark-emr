# Airflow - PySpark + S3 + EMR - Data Lake  

## Description
This project demonstrate how to process data stored in a data lake fashion, transforming it into an OLAP optimized structure by using PySpark. 

The PySpark Job runs on AWS EMR, and the Data Pipeline is orchestrated by Apache Airflow, including the whole infrastructure creation and the EMR cluster termination.

 ### Requirements:

 - Python 3.6 or greater.

 
### Running the project:  
 -  Clone this repository
 - Edit the `dl.cfg` file with your AWS credentials and infrastructure configuration. Note: Follow the hints in the dl .cfg file
 -  `cd` into airflow-pyspark-emr
 - Create and activate a virtualenv, docs: [venv documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/venv.html)   , then:
 - (venv) $ pip install -r requirements.txt
 - Add AIRFLOW_HOME environment variable to ~/.bashrc, by adding the line:										

    export AIRFLOW_HOME=your_path_to/airflow-pyspark-emr/airflow_home
    to the end of the ~/.bashrc file

 -  Run `airflow initdb`
 -  In another terminal, run `airflow scheduler`
 - In another terminal, run `airflow webserver`
 - Access Airflow UI in localhost:8080

In the UI, two DAG's should be available: 

 - songs_etl
 - terminate_emr_clusters

Turn them on and play with it.

### Main files:
 - airflow_home/plugins/spark_jobs - etl.py:
 
     - This file has the PySpark logic and usage.
 
 - airflow_home/plugins/aws_utils - emr_deployment.py:
 
    - This file has the logic to control the AWS infrastructure needed for the job to run.


## Data Lakes with PySpark, EMR and S3

### Concepts:

- Data Lake:

    A data lake is a system or repository of data stored in its natural/raw format, usually object blobs or files.
    
- Spark:

    Apache Spark is a unified analytics engine for big data processing, with built-in modules for streaming, SQL, machine learning and graph processing.

### Project:

        A music streaming startup, Sparkify, has grown their user base and song database and want to move their processes and data onto the cloud. Their data resides in S3, in a directory of JSON logs on user activity on the app, as well as a directory with JSON metadata on the songs in their app.

### Dataset:
- Song Dataset :
    
    The song data set is a subset of the [Million Song Dataset](https://labrosa.ee.columbia.edu/millionsong/).

    Each item contains metadata about a song and it's artist.

    Example format:

    ``` json
    {
        "num_songs": 1, 
        "artist_longitude": null,
        "artist_latitute": null,
        "artist_location": "", 
        "artist_name": "Line Renaud", 
        "song_id": "SOUPIRU12A6D4FA1E1", 
        "title": "Der Kleine Dompfaff", 
        "duration": 152.92036, 
        "year": 0
    }
    ```

- Logs Dataset:

    The logs dataset is a simulation of events generated by this [Event Simulator](https://github.com/Interana/eventsim).

    They are stored in s3 with the following bucket organization structure:

    ``` 
    log_data/2018/11/2018-11-12-events.json
    log_data/2018/11/2018-11-13-events.json
    ```
    
    The json file format has the following structure:

    ``` json
    {
        "artist":null,
        "auth":"Logged In",
        "firstName":"Walter",
        "gender":"M",
        "itemInSession":0,
        "lastName":"Frye",
        "length":null,
        "level":"free",
        "location":"San Francisco-Oakland-Hayward, CA",
        "method":"GET",
        "page":"Home",
        "registration":1540919166796.0,
        "sessionId":38,
        "song":null,
        "status":200,
        "ts":1541105830796,
        "userAgent":"\"Mozilla\/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_9_4) AppleWebKit\/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome\/36.0.1985.143 Safari\/537.36\"",
        "userId":"39"
    }
    ```

### Data Lake Schema:

The target schema should look as follows:

- **Fact Table**:
    - **Table songplays** - records in event data associated with song plays i.e. records with page NextSong
        - Columns: songplay_id, start_time, user_id, level, song_id, artist_id, session_id, location, user_agent

- **Dimension Tables**:
    - **Table users**: users in the app
        - Columns: user_id, first_name, last_name, gender, level
    - **Table songs**: songs in music database
        - Columns: song_id, title, artist_id, year, duration
    - **Table artists**: artists in music database
        - Columns: artist_id, name, location, lattitude, longitude
    - **Table time**: timestamps of records in songplays broken down into specific units
        - Columns: start_time, hour, day, week, month, year, weekday
